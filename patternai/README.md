# Weaving patterns with artificial intelligence

A tutorial in three parts, by [Uche Ogbuji](http://uche.ogbuji.net)

[Part 1: Letter correlation and simple language statistics for AI](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/cc-patterns-artificial-intelligence-part1/)

AI is more than pattern recognition. It can also build on patterns to generate expression.
This is increasingly important in the world of intelligent agents. Learn about generative AI, an
important class of techniques to the modern developer. As a first step, consider the patterns in
natural language and how these can be modeled to prepare machines to generate their own
expressions of familiar language. Discover how to go from basic letter frequency statistics to
correlation between letters by using matrix-based models.

[Part 2: Word analysis and N-grams in a variety of practical applications](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/cc-patterns-artificial-intelligence-part2/)

Build on the concept of N-grams of sequential letters to look at N-grams of words, and the
statistics that can be derived from these. Learn how to generate graphical plots of N-gram
frequencies. Explore the American National Corpus as an enormous and rich source of English
text suitable for general-purpose language modeling tasks.

[Part 3: Using Markov Chains to generate language from letter correlation matrices and N-grams](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/cc-patterns-artificial-intelligence-part3/)

Now that you have learned how to compile statistics of letter correlation and word correlation in
model natural language text, put it to work having the computer generate text of its own. Learn
how to write programs that create sequences of letters or words based on randomly generated
transitions to complete N-grams.
