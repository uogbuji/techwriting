# Workshop: Iterators, generators, coroutines and asyncio

Python developers should learn effective use of the iterator protocol when crunching large datasets. The lineage of such techniques extends to Python 3â€™s asyncio, valuable in boosting network applications. This workshop progresses from a firm grounding in iterators through generators & asyncio.
