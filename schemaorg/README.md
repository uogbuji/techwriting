# Schema.org

Almost as soon as the web took off in popularity, people started looking to make it smarter.
The trick has been balancing pragmatism with some of the more ambitious ideas of semantic technology and cognitive computing.
It has also been important for any such initiative to be based on open specifications, to garner the broadest adoption.
The most successful effort so far to achieve this balance is [Schema.org](https://Schema.org), an initiative originally by search engines companies and experts to support web publishers in making search results more immediately information rich for users.
Schema.org is also a versatile set of conventions for marking up HTML so all sorts of automated applications can use them in all sorts of novel ways.

Learn how to make your web pages and applications more useful in a world of increasingly automated usage workflows and applications that go beyond the desktop or mobile browser. You've already accepted that it is crucial to make your web pages responsive to accommodate different usage form factors, from desktop to mobile. Expand your web developer skills so that you can also make your pages more broadly relevant by accommodating different information platforms, including search engines, but going well beyond, including to personal assistants such as Siri, Google Assistant and Alexa.
