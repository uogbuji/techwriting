# Principles of XML design

Five part article series by [Uche Ogbuji](http://uche.ogbuji.net)

## [Part 1: When to use elements versus attributes](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/x-eleatt/index.html)

**Exploring the oldest question in XML design**

The oldest question asked by adopters of XML is when to use elements and when to use
attributes in XML design. As with most design issues, this question rarely has absolute
answers, but developers have also experienced a lack of very clear guidelines to help them
make this decision. In this article, Uche Ogbuji offers a set of guiding principles for what to put
in elements and what to put in attributes.

## [Part 2: Use XML namespaces with care](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-namcar/index.html)

**Principles of XML design**

XML namespaces are an imperfect solution to a difficult problem. From basic information
architecture to difficulties with APIs, namespaces can open up rather painful gotchas if used
carelessly. In this article, Uche Ogbuji covers some of the more important design principles
which, if followed, can minimize problems with namespaces.

## [Part 3: Element structures for names and addresses](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-elemdes/x-elemdes-pdf.pdf)

**Although these structures are common, never trivialize them**

A critical issue in designing XML formats is figuring out how to arrange elements and represent
relationships between them. Element design works best when it naturally corresponds to how
people think about the concepts that each element represents. This article discusses best
practices for organizing information into XML elements, focusing on representation of names
and addresses.

## [Part 4: Considering container elements](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-contain/index.html)

**When to use elements to wrap structures of other elements**

A critical issue in designing XML formats is figuring out how to arrange elements and represent
relationships between them. Element design works best when it naturally corresponds to
how people think about the concepts that each element represents. This article discusses
best practices for organizing information into XML elements, focusing on the use of container
elements.

## [Part 5: When the order of XML elements matters](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-eleord/index.html)

**When to be strict and when to be lax as you decide how to order child elements**

When multiple XML elements occur within another element, does element order matter?
Whether it's the order in which the parser reports elements to applications, or the question of
whether or not to mandate specific order in schema patterns, things are not always as simple
as they may seem. In this article, Uche Ogbuji covers design and processing considerations
related to the order of XML elements.
