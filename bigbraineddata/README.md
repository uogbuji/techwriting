# [Big-brained data](https://developer.ibm.com/series/big-brained-data/)

A tutorial in two parts, by [Uche Ogbuji](http://uche.ogbuji.net)

[Part 1: Pay attention to the data to get the most out of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cognitive computing](https://developer.ibm.com/articles/cc-cognitive-big-brained-data-pt1/)

Gain a sound understanding of the crucial role of data in the development of artificial intelligence and cognitive applications, and how this importance has developed throughout the history of AI, though not always explicitly acknowledged. Learn how the quality and quantity of available data can make all the difference in pattern analysis and training. AI is experiencing a resurgence on the web, but the understanding that a good data corpus is the lifeblood of any AI is not widespread. Learn to avoid the enormous danger from AI doing more harm than good if problems of bias and statistical skew propagate from the data corpus. Gain an edge in developing successful AI applications by understanding the role of data in various AI techniques, and the characteristics of data sets that support those techniques.

[Part 2: Apply the software development lifecycle to the data that feeds AI applications](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/cc-cognitive-big-brained-data-pt2/)

Learn how to apply the iterative software development lifecycle (SDLC) to data for artificial intelligence (AI) and cognitive applications. Improve your systems for sourcing and assessment of data sets, and controlling dimensionality, all the way through the evaluation that feeds each iteration in the cycle.
