I'm done with GitHub Gist. Clearly bitrotted to within an inch of its life. Buggy AF, and worst of all, can't be trusted with clipboard integrity, which IMO is a death sentence offence.

Did some digging around & found [OpenGist](https://github.com/thomiceli/opengist), etc. But then figured, why not just stick to plain old, corporate-maintained GitHub proper? This is that.

For now my old gists are still at https://gist.github.com/uogbuji
